## Known Failure Modes

## 2026-07-15 - Package-scoped Vitest command resolved paths from the package directory

### Symptom

The first A02 package test script found no tests. Adding both a workspace root and the original relative config path then resolved the config outside the repository.

### Root Cause

`pnpm --filter <package> test` runs the script with the package as its working directory, while Vitest resolves `root`, `config`, include globs, and positional file filters at different stages. The root config's workspace-relative include pattern did not match when treated as package-relative.

### Fix

The contracts package script sets `--root ../..`, names `vitest.config.ts` relative to that root, and supplies `packages/contracts/test` as a positional filter.

### Prevention

For future package-scoped test scripts, first verify the actual working directory. Use `pnpm --filter <package> --fail-if-no-match test`, keep the full root test command as the authoritative aggregate check, and confirm both commands discover the intended tests.
