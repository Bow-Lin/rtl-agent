## Known Failure Modes

## 2026-07-15 - Package-scoped Vitest command resolved paths from the package directory

### Symptom

The first A02 package test script found no tests. Adding both a workspace root and the original relative config path then resolved the config outside the repository.

### Root Cause

`pnpm --filter <package> test` runs the script with the package as its working directory, while Vitest resolves `root`, `config`, include globs, and positional file filters at different stages. The root config's workspace-relative include pattern did not match when treated as package-relative.

### Fix

The contracts package script sets `--root ../..`, names `vitest.config.ts` relative to that root, and supplies `packages/contracts/test` as a positional filter.

### Prevention

For future package-scoped test scripts, first verify the actual working directory. Use `pnpm --filter <package> --fail-if-no-match test`, keep the full root test command as the authoritative aggregate check, and confirm both commands discover the intended tests.

## 2026-07-16 - Host-path sanitizer alternated between URL false positives and quoted-path false negatives

### Symptom

The first generic Windows drive rule redacted the tail of an HTTP URL. After preserving HTTP(S), a guarded review showed that quoted POSIX paths and `file://` paths still passed through unchanged.

### Root Cause

The sanitizer tried to infer every host path with broad expressions but did not define URL classes and path-token boundaries independently. The captured-output Schema reused that same incomplete detector, so it did not provide an independent fail-closed result.

### Fix

Preserve ordinary HTTP(S) URLs, explicitly redact `file://` URLs, accept punctuation and quotes as POSIX path boundaries, and add the same quoted/file cases to capture and Schema-boundary tests. The Schema also now applies its preview maximum using UTF-8 byte length rather than JavaScript string length.

### Prevention

Every path sanitizer change must test Windows drive, UNC, bare POSIX, quoted POSIX, `file://`, HTTP(S), and multibyte byte-limit cases at both the helper and public Schema boundaries.
