## Known Failure Modes

## 2026-07-15 - Package-scoped Vitest command resolved paths from the package directory

### Symptom

The first A02 package test script found no tests. Adding both a workspace root and the original relative config path then resolved the config outside the repository.

### Root Cause

`pnpm --filter <package> test` runs the script with the package as its working directory, while Vitest resolves `root`, `config`, include globs, and positional file filters at different stages. The root config's workspace-relative include pattern did not match when treated as package-relative.

### Fix

The contracts package script sets `--root ../..`, names `vitest.config.ts` relative to that root, and supplies `packages/contracts/test` as a positional filter.

### Prevention

For future package-scoped test scripts, first verify the actual working directory. Use `pnpm --filter <package> --fail-if-no-match test`, keep the full root test command as the authoritative aggregate check, and confirm both commands discover the intended tests.

## 2026-07-16 - Host-path sanitizer alternated between URL false positives and quoted-path false negatives

### Symptom

The first generic Windows drive rule redacted the tail of an HTTP URL. After preserving HTTP(S), a guarded review showed that quoted POSIX paths and `file://` paths still passed through unchanged.

### Root Cause

The sanitizer tried to infer every host path with broad expressions but did not define URL classes and path-token boundaries independently. The captured-output Schema reused that same incomplete detector, so it did not provide an independent fail-closed result.

### Fix

Preserve ordinary HTTP(S) URLs, explicitly redact `file://` URLs, accept punctuation and quotes as POSIX path boundaries, and add the same quoted/file cases to capture and Schema-boundary tests. The Schema also now applies its preview maximum using UTF-8 byte length rather than JavaScript string length.

### Prevention

Every path sanitizer change must test Windows drive, UNC, bare POSIX, quoted POSIX, `file://`, HTTP(S), and multibyte byte-limit cases at both the helper and public Schema boundaries.

## 2026-07-16 - R02 assumed cwd and relative OpenCode permission paths were stable

### Symptom

Package-scoped tests and the first CLI probe looked for `.opencode` below a package directory. The first real turn then fell back to OpenCode's default Agent because `--dir` made the isolated run workspace the project root. After trusted Agent discovery was fixed, every read/write/edit still returned an error even for declared relative paths.

### Root Cause

`pnpm --filter` changes cwd, OpenCode `--dir` changes project-local config discovery, and OpenCode 1.18.2 on Windows resolves file-tool inputs to absolute workspace paths before permission matching. The probe also assumed help text was stdout although this version emits it on stderr.

### Fix

Derive the repository root from the CLI/test module location, fix trusted `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` to repository `.opencode`, accept help from bounded stdout plus stderr, and pair relative read/edit allow rules with constrained `**/` workspace-suffix forms. Parse and digest the final `agent list` permission array instead of checking only the Agent name. Real smoke now proves both allowed RTL generation and an actually denied write with no resulting file.

### Prevention

Run every CLI test both from the repository root and through its package-scoped pnpm script. Treat cwd, `--dir`, config discovery, help channels and permission path normalization as probed tool behavior, not assumptions. Do not mark a permission test passed unless an actual tool result is denied and the filesystem postcondition agrees.

## 2026-07-16 - R02 timeout swallowed termination failures and waited forever

### Symptom

Guarded commit review found that a timed-out OpenCode process could hang forever if process-tree termination failed, because the error was discarded and the runner still awaited `close` without a deadline.

### Root Cause

Only the model turn had a timeout. Windows `taskkill`, the composed graceful/force sequence, and final close confirmation were not independently bounded. The first fix also treated a normal Windows escalation race as failure: non-force `taskkill` can fail for a console process even though the subsequent forced tree kill succeeds.

### Fix

Add hard deadlines around termination commands, the composed termination operation, and close confirmation. Continue from a failed graceful signal to forced tree termination, distinguish confirmed normal timeout from unconfirmed termination, and release pipe/process handles before returning an error for an unconfirmed child.

### Prevention

Every external-process timeout test must cover successful tree kill, a terminator that never settles, and a child that never closes after nominal termination. Do not swallow kill errors without a separate positive termination confirmation.

## 2026-07-16 - R02 experiment digest omitted executable prefix arguments

### Symptom

Guarded commit review found that two turns with different `executableArgumentsPrefix` values produced the same experiment digest even though their actual argv differed. The task breakdown also retained the test counts from before timeout hardening.

### Root Cause

The digest covered model, limits, isolation and Agent settings but omitted the operator-owned launcher prefix used by every probe and turn. Acceptance evidence was updated in the handoff files but not in the task breakdown, which is the project progress source.

### Fix

Snapshot the operator config at adapter construction, include every non-empty prefix argument in order in the JCS experiment digest, and add a probe-level drift/mutation regression test. Normalize omitted and empty prefixes to the same no-prefix behavior. Synchronize the task breakdown with the final test-file and test counts.

### Prevention

Every operator-controlled value that changes executable argv must either participate in the experiment identity or be explicitly documented as non-semantic. After adding tests during guarded fixes, update both handoff evidence and the task breakdown from the same final run.
